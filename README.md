# Kata
This repository is where I keep code I write when practicing code kata.

A code kata is a simple, artificial exercise which allows one to experiment and learn without the pressure of a production environment. 
the kata I practice here are described on the [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/) web site.

## Kata02 - Karate (Binary) Chop
This [kata](kata02) is all about the binary search of sorted arrays. Even though it is a simple concept there is plenty
to explore over the course of five days.
